# Get smallest range

## Find smallest range containing elements from k lists
Given k sorted lists of integers of size n each, find the smallest range that includes at least element from each of the k lists. If more than one smallest ranges are found, print any one of them.

## Examples :
```
Example 01:

Input:
K = 3
arr1[] : [4, 7, 9, 12, 15]
arr2[] : [0, 8, 10, 14, 20]
arr3[] : [6, 12, 16, 30, 50]
Output:
The smallest range is [6 8] 
Explanation: Smallest range is formed by 
number 7 from first list, 8 from second
list and 6 from third list.

Example 02:
Input: 
k = 3
arr1[] : [4, 7]
arr2[] : [1, 2]
arr3[] : [20, 40]
The smallest range is [2 20]
